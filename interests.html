	<h2> Sports</h2>
		<p>When it comes to sports, I consider myself to be eclectic in my likes. My favorite sports are football,football(American) and baseball. I will get into the debate of calling soccer football in other sections. Go to my "culture" section to read more about that issue. Some of my favorite sports teams are:</p>

	<h2> Culture</h2>
		<p>I would first like to start this section by discussing some cultural hurdles I've experienced as an American.As previously stated, I have traveled overseas, and met various types of people from all walks of life. I tend to agree with other non Americans when they say that America seems to go "against the grain" in many aspects. We(Americans) have not managed to fully appreciate the World's sport of football(a.ka. soccer in America). I often wonder why Americans also refer to American football as football. The only part of the game when the foot touches the ball is during kickoffs, extra points, onside kicks,and punts.I find myself to be a very literal individual and calling soccer football makes no sense to me.Another issue I find myself struggling to grasp is America's unwillingness to adopt the metric system. Don't you find it rather frustrating having to  convert units just to accurately get a reading of something!?I do!</p>
